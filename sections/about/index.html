		<p>ABOUT SOCE</p>
	</section>
	<p class="text">
		SOCE (society of civil engineers, IIT Kanpur) is a non-profit organization. It serves as a link between
		enrolled civil engineering students, alumni and professors at IIT Kanpur. This society is an effort to allow
		free communication and sharing of ideas and information among all. The constant support and help
		from the students and faculty members is helping this society to help more and more number of
		students every day. The only thing that we want to say to all the members of this society is, Keep it up
		your noble work!!<br><br>
		Years of research in higher education supports the fact that student‚Äêfaculty
		 interaction is positively associated with several aspects of student success,
		  for example, academic performance, persistence to graduation, personal and intellectual development,
		   educational aspirations, satisfaction with faculty and department, career prospects, curriculum development, etc.
			The interaction has been identified as one of the primary sources influencing students' attitudes, interests
			, and values and plays a vital role in the learning environment. Therefore, better interaction between students and faculty
			 is necessary for any educational institute's overall development. In order to develop a good interaction between students 
			 and faculty of the Civil Engineering Department of IITK, The Society Of Civil Engineers plays an active role in improving 
			 the Faculty-Student interaction in the department. This is done through a series of cultural (departmental get-togethers )
			  and intellectual (Talk Series, Workshops,) events. Such events are organized with extreme levels of enthusiasm among students
			   and faculties. We always work hard in order to bring students and faculties on the same platform, so now, we should
			    understand our responsibilities and make this idea a  huge success.
