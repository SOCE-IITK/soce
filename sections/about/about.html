                SOCE stands for the Society Of Civil Engineers, IIT Kanpur. It has been in existence for more than 3 decades and continues showing its strong presence till the day. It serves as a link between various batches of 'civilians' who have passed out from this institute, professors and anybody remotely related with Civil Engineering@IITK. This site is again an effort to allow free communication and sharing of ideas and information among its members.
