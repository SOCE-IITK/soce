                <li> <h4> <b>Description </b>: In conventional constitutive modelling of materials, an appropriate mathematical model is initially selected and the parameters of this model (material parameters) are then identified from appropriate physical tests on representative samples to capture the material behaviour. When these constitutive models are used in finite element analysis, the accuracy with which the selected material model represents the various aspects of the actual material behaviour affects the accuracy of the finite element prediction. In the past few years, the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) has been introduced as an alternative approach to constitutive modelling of materials. The role of ANNs in constitutive modelling was also studied by a number of other researchers . The studies indicated that neural network-based constitutive models can capture nonlinear material behaviour with high accuracy. The potential advantage of using neural network based constitutive models (NNCMs) when they are trained directly from experimental (or in-situ) data is that in this case, an unknown conventional analytical constitutive description can be directly replaced with a suitably trained neural network. We will explore more in this area. As the area is so versatile, machine learning can be applied in any field.

Workers equally dominate the Indian construction industry, along with automation. They form the backbone of the construction business in India. The geographical and cultural variation inside India is more than in any other country. Despite these variations in India, the workers migrate from one place to another for work. Sometimes workers also move along with the employer from one project to another in different construction project sites. The relationship between the construction manager's leadership style and the work-life balance of construction workers for the Indian construction industry is still unexplored. There may be variations in leadership style due to cultural and geographical variations, which may affect construction workers' work-life balance. Thus, this study analyses the importance and relationship between the leadership style and the workers' work-life balance.

                <li> <h4> <b> Mentor </b>: Sukhdeep Singh</h4>  </li>
                <li> <h4> <b>Description </b>: The vibration control of railway bridges under high-speed trains has been an area of interest recently to researchers. This topic has fascinated the researchers for so long and many studies have been carried out to suppress the vibration levels using various passive vibration control devices. The most commonly used one is Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD). But the problem with TMDs is that it requires a large amount of mass and also it operates on a particular resonant frequency. To deal with these problems, the concept of Multiple tuned mass dampers (MTMDs) was introduced. For the last two decades, an interesting vibration control device ‘inerter’ has been tested and verified for the efficiency of vibration control of structures. The structures tested for vibration control using inerter -integrated devices includes high-rise buildings, mechanical vehicles, etc. But a limited number of studies have been carried out for the vibration control of railway bridges using Inerter based devices. Under this research topic, we are working on the inerter based vibration control of railway bridges under high speed trains. An inerter is a two-node mechanical device that generates a restoring force proportional to the relative acceleration between two nodes. The inerter assembly is made of either ball screw or rack and pinion type mechanism. The inerter is also capable of providing large effective mass despite of having very small mass and this is ascribed to the conversion of translational motion into rotational motion.The analysis and simulation for the trainload modeling and the railway bridge modelling assisted with inerter based vibration control device is being carried out by OpenSees simulation tool. The displacement and acceleration response of railway bridges with and without the inerter based damping device will be carried out and compared.
