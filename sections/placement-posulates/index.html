				Hello Everyone!<br>
				My name is Vishal Agarwal (Y17, CE), currently placed at MTX Group and today I am going to give you a student’s perspective, something really honest and straightforward because that’s an element often missing in the talks that are given by the companies. I’m just currently a student like all of you and the things I am going to talk about will admittedly be anecdotal. <br>Some of the firms that I have interviewed with include BlackRock, Capital One, Deskera,

				Hi people!<br>
				Let me share my story. So, I am Shashi Shekhar. I got placed in Blackrock on Day 1 during the placement season 20-21. My extra-curricular involvements changed with every year, but the major ones have been Manager- Research, Academics and Career Council and Senator, Y17.<br>In the first 3-4 semesters, I was not sure if I was going to sit for the placements, so I didn’t give much heed to the preparation or developing relevant technical skills (read coding/finance etc).

				I am Samyak Jain, a final year undergraduate in Civil Engineering. I am currently placed at Navi technologies, a startup in the BFSI industry, as a Software developer.<br>You might be thinking how a Civil guy lands in the job of software engineer, right? Let’s lookout.<br>During the summers after my second year, I had very little knowledge and direction about the preparation for the internship. So, with the advice of seniors, I took one core project.

				Hello Everyone!<br>
				I am Rajat Ghoshal, a Final Year Undergraduate (Y17) in Civil Engineering, hoping for minors in IME and ML (a retrospective one :p). About academics - with a CPI just enough for distinction, I have been working on an undergraduate project in my final year focusing on data analysis in Geo-informatics. Not much into the extracurriculars, but yeah I am the student representative in Cell for Differently Abled Persons (a.k.a. CDAP). I was also a Student Guide. Currently, I am placed as a Data Scientist at Hilabs Inc.

				Greetings Everyone!<br>
				I am Vineet Shukla, a Y17 Civil Engineering student currently hustling through all major formalities of the final semester at IITK. I am at home, for now, struggling to recover my lost sense of smell and taste, waiting for my joining, and convincing people to write in my yearbook. My life at IITK has been full of highs and lows, dubious junctures, euphoria, and awes. From starting with a CPI of 8.6 to ending with something around 7, from not being able to decide which club to join,
