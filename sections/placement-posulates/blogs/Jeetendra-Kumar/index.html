        <p>Let me first introduce myself.  I am Jeetendra Kumar Patel (Y16), B.Tech in CE, IITK.  Currently, I am working in IOCL, I got placed in Phase 2 last year.
        I wanted to write the IES exam that is why I focused only on core companies. Tata was the first core company that had a good package in Phase 1; I thought I should try and lucky me, I was selected for the interview. Tata came on Day 3, I prepared for the interview as much as I could. That was the first interview of my life, somehow, I trained myself for the interview and I went for it. I was not selected because I did not perform well. That was a very bad time but somehow, I survived. In this way, my Phase 1 was over And I moved towards Phase 2. I heard from some seniors and SPO that the chances that a core company would come are higher in phase 2.</p>
        <p>We all know that in Phase 1 most of the companies come for these profiles: Coding, Data Analyst, Product Manager and some more related non-core profiles. The chance that a core company will come is very less.  All the PSUs come in Phase 2, so this is the biggest advantage in Phase 2. When I was going to take part in Phase 2, IOCL and ITI came after the lockdown was forced.</p>
        <p>Let me tell you the process for IOCL:
            <ol>
            <li>Preplacement talk</li>
            <li>Group discussion</li>
            <li>Group task </li>
            <li>Interview; They took interviews of all the candidates irrespective of GD and GT score.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of companies that arrive in Phase 2 is high. Even the number of core companies that arrive is also decent. Companies like PSU and most of the companies offer an agreeable package.  
In Phase 2, the competition is not too high, because most of the students are placed by then. When Phase 2 start, we already have some experience in giving interviews and from those experiences, we know what our weaknesses were and now we are ready.

            Friends se jitna help le sakte ho lo yahi kaam aayenge... Let me tell you my story.<br>
Mere case me mera ek friend tha 'Hardik Harsh'. Mai apna pura placement ka credit isi bande ko dena chahunga. Bahut help kiya tha placement ke time. Placement ke time daily mere sath jata mujhe motivate karta raha. Jab kisi company me nahin hota tha tab bolta tha teri achhi jagah placement hogiüòÇ, usne mock interview and GD ki khoob practice karwai thi. Even mere IOCL ke time result ka wait vo hi kar raha tha SPO me aur sabse pehle usne hi mujhe bataya bhai tu placed ho gaya hai aur bola dekh meri baat sach ho gayiüòÇ.
        </p>
        <p>
            At last friends se help mango jitna ho sake utna, contact me raho, be confident, chaap doge sabüôè. All the best!
